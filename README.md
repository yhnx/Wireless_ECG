# Wireless ECG Acquisition System

This repository contains the design files, documentation, and implementation details for a wireless ECG acquisition system intended for integration into wearable health-monitoring devices. The system captures low-amplitude biopotential signals, conditions and digitizes them using a high-resolution analog front end, and transmits the data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for real-time monitoring.

## Features
- High-accuracy ECG signal acquisition suitable for wearable applications  
- Differential analog front end with DRL circuitry  
- High-resolution ADC for precise digitization  
- BLE-enabled microcontroller for wireless transmission  
- Low-noise power architecture with LDO regulation  
- Optimized PCB layout with analog–digital isolation  

## Repository Contents
- **/schematics** – Complete schematic diagrams of the analog front end, ADC stage, power system, and BLE module  
- **/pcb_layout** – PCB design files and layer stack-up information  
- **/documentation** – Design notes, block diagrams, and system explanations  
- **/references** – Supporting images used in the documentation  

## Applications
- Wearable ECG monitors  
- Remote patient health-tracking devices  
- Portable biomedical instrumentation  
- Research and prototyping of ECG-based systems
