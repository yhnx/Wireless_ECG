# Wireless ECG Acquisition System

This repository contains the design files, documentation and implementation details for a wireless ECG acquisition system intended for integration into wearable health-monitoring devices. The system captures low-amplitude biopotential signals, conditions and digitizes them using a high-resolution analog front end, and transmits the data over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for real-time monitoring.
